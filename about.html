      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a <strong>creative and detail-oriented Web Designer</strong> with a strong foundation in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>Bootstrap</strong>. I love turning simple ideas into beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly websites.
        <br><br>
        With HTML and CSS, I build clean and well-structured layouts. Using Bootstrap, I speed up the design process and create mobile-friendly interfaces with ease.
        <br><br>
        I focus on creating websites that look good on every device and provide a smooth user experience. I enjoy working with modern design trends, clean typography, and simple but effective layouts.
        <br><br>
        My goal is to build visually attractive websites that reflect the identity of the brand or individual behind them. I’m constantly learning and improving my skills to stay updated with the latest design standards.
        <br><br>
        For me, web design is not just about visuals — it’s about creating meaningful and usable digital spaces.
